  The site uses Google Analytics. Google Analytics cookies helps to distinguish  between different users and understand how often a particular user visits the  site, how the user got to the site, and the user’s activity on the site.  Google developed two resources – How Google Uses Information from Sites or  Apps that Use Our Services and Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on – to  help provide website visitors more information and choice on how their data is  collected when websites use Google services.
